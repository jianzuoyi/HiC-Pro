HiC-Pro failed. How to find what's going wrong ?
------------------------------------------------

| A log file is generated when you run HiC-Pro. Its name is specified in the configuration file. 
| In addition, some parts of the pipeline generate specific logs which are available in the *log* folder


How can I split my .fastq files into smaller files ?
----------------------------------------------------

See the :ref:`HiC-Pro Utilities <UTILS>` which is baed on the split unix command.
For more information, see :code:`man split`

How can I used my own annotations files
---------------------------------------

Simply put the full path of your annotations in the configuration files. By default HiC-Pro will check if the file exists, and if not, will look for it inn its annotation folder.

How can I generate my annotation files ?
----------------------------------------

HiC-Pro requires two annotation files.

* The chromosomes size are usually available through annotation website, such as the UCSC Genome Browser:

   - `hg19 <http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=13085504&chromInfoPage=>`_

   - `mm9 <http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm9&chromInfoPage=>`_

   - ...

Another way to generate this file is, for instance, to use the R environment.

   require(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)

   human_chr <- seqlevels(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)[1:25]
   chrom.size <- seqlengths(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)[human_chr]
   write.table(chrom_size, file="chrom_hg19.sizes", quote=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, sep="\t")


* The restriction fragments file has to be generated according to the reference genome, and the restriction enzyme(s) used to generate the Hi-C data.

| Since version 2.7.0, HiC-Pro proposes the utility *digest_genome.py* to generate this file using as input, the fasta file and the name(s) or sequence(s) of the restriction enzyme(s).
| See the :ref:`HiC-Pro Utilities <UTILS>` section for more details.
| Another way is to generate the list of restriction fragments is to use the `HiTC <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HiTC.html>`_ BioConductor package. 
| Note that this method only works for the genomes which are already available in BioConductor and for one restriction enzyme. 
| The packages `HiTC <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HiTC.html>`_, `rtracklayer <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html>`_ and `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.html>`_ have to be already installed to run the following example.

   human_chr <- seqlevels(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)[1:25]
   resFrag <- getRestrictionFragmentsPerChromosome(resSite="AAGCTT", chromosomes=human_chr, overhangs5=1, genomePack="BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
   allRF <- do.call("c",resFrag)
   names(allRF) <- unlist(sapply(resFrag, function(x){paste0("HIC_", seqlevels(x), "_", 1:length(x))}))
   export(allRF, format="bed", con="HindIII_resfrag_hg19.bed")


Why HiC-Pro need to be run in two steps in parallel mode ?
----------------------------------------------------------

Th HiC-Pro pipeline is divided into two main steps. The first part of the pipeline is 'fastq' based, meaning that the same anlaysis will be performed for all fastq files.
This part can be easily parallelized per fastq, with at the end, a list of valid interactions per fastq file.
The second step of the pipeline is 'sample' based. All lists of valid interactions from the same sample are merged in order to build and normalize the maps.
At that time, this second step is not time consuming, and we do not parallelize it although a per sample parallelization migth be a good idea.
So, because these two steps as either 'fastq' based or 'sample' based, we need to separate them during the parallele processing.


Does HiC-Pro support other mappers ?
------------------------------------

No. HiC-Pro is only based on the bowtie2 mapper.
However, note that HiC-Pro can be run from aligned data. In this case, the input path (-i) must be a BAM folder, and the analysis has to be run step-by-step.


How can I create N-masked genome for allele-specific analysis ?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The allele specific mode of HiC-Pro is based on a N-masked genome. Meaning that all SNPs information which can be use to distinguish parental haplotypes have to be masked. This masking can be performed in 3 steps:
1. Extract relevant SNPs information. See the :ref:`extract_snps.py <UTILS>` utility for Mouse Sanger data. For Human data, you can use phasing data, or SNPs information available from public ressources, as the `Illumina Platinum Project <http://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes/>`_, the `1K Genome Project <http://www.1000genomes.org/>`_ or the `GATK resource bundle <https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article.php?id=1215>`_.
2. Mask the fasta genome. To do so, simply use the bedtools `maskfasta <http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/maskfasta.html>`_ utility.
3. Then, create your bowtie2 indexes from the masked fasta file.


What can I do once I have the iced contact maps
-----------------------------------------------

The matrix format is a standard sparse triplet format which can easoly be loaded in R or matlab environment.
For instance, the matrix can be easily loaded in the R environment using the `HiTC Bioconductor package <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HiTC.html>`_.

.. code-block:: guess

   require(HiTC)
   ## Load Hi-C data
   x<-importC("mydata.matrix", xgi.bed="mydata_abs.bed")
   show(x)
   ## Plot X intra-chromosomal map
   mapC(HTClist(x$chrXchrX), trim.range=.9)


How can I visualize the maps generated by HiC-Pro
-------------------------------------------------

The maps can be plotted into througth R environment. See the `HiTC Bioconductor package <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HiTC.html>`_. and the previous question.
The HiC-pro results are also compatible with the HiCPlotter software (`Akdemir et al. 2015 <http://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/198>`_).
The source of HiCPlotter are available on `github <https://github.com/kcakdemir/HiCPlotter>`_.
Here is a small example of how to use HiCPlotter.

.. code-block:: guess

   ## Plot the genome-wide map at 1Mb resolution
   python HiCPlotter.py -f hic_results/matrix/sample1/iced/1000000/sample1_1000000_iced.matrix -o Examplegw -r 1000000 -tri 1 -bed hic_results/matrix/sample1/raw/1000000/sample1_1000000_ord.bed -n hES -wg 1 -chr chrX

   ## Plot the chrX at 150Kb resolution
   python HiCPlotter.py -f hic_results/matrix/sample1/iced/150000/sample1_150000_iced.matrix -o Exemple -r 150000 -tri 1 -bed hic_results/matrix/sample1/raw/150000/sample1_150000_ord.bed -n Test -chr chrX -ptr 1

Since version 2.7.6 HiC-Pro is compatible with the Juicebox viewer. See the hicpro2juicebox utility to generate Juicebox input file from the list of valid interactions.

How much disk space is require for running HiC-Pro
--------------------------------------------------

| In average, HiC-Pro requires 4 times more space than the raw data (more if the fastq files are compressed). 
| The main part of this disk space is required for the mapping only, as HiC-Pro will map R1 and R2 independantly, in two steps. And then, merge the R1 and R2 alignments at the pairing step. So for 1 sample (R1 + R2 input files), 8 intermediate BAM files are generated.
| The final matrix files are not that big, and the triplet format used by HiC-Pro is very efficient.
| Therefore, a good habit would be to remove mapping files after running HiC-Pro.
